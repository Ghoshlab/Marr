## Introduction

Reproducibility is an on-going challenge with high-throughput technologies that have been developed in the last two decades for quantifying a wide range of biological processes. One of the main difficulties faced by researchers is the variability of output across replicate experiments @li2011measuring. Several authors have addressed the issue of reproducibility among high-throughput experiments @porazinska2010reproducibility, marioni2008rna, ac2013reproducibility. In each high-throughput experiment (e.g., arrays, sequencing, mass spectrometry), a large number of features are measured simultaneously, and candidates are often subjected for follow-up statistical analysis. We use the term features to refer to biological features (e.g., metabolites, genes) resulting from a high-throughput experiment in the rest of this article.  When measurements show consistency across replicate experiments, we define that measurement to be reproducible. Similarly, measurements that are not consistent across replicates may be problematic and should be identified. In this vignette, features that show consistency across high-dimensional replicate experiments are termed reproducible and the ones that are not consistent are termed irreproducible.   The reproducibility of a high-throughput experiment primarily depends on the technical variables, such as run time, technical replicates, laboratory operators and biological variables, such as healthy and diseased subjects. A critical step toward making optimal design choices is to assess how these biological and technical variables affect reproducibility across replicate experiments @talloen2010filtering, arvidsson2008quantprime. 

In this vignette, we introduce the marr procedure @Philtron2018, referred to as **maximum rank reproducibility** (**marr**) to identify reproducible features in high-throughput replicate experiments. The marr procedure was originally proposed to assess reproducibility of gene ranks in replicate experiments. The `marr` R-package contains the `marr()` function, which calculates  a matrix of signals ($\text{irreproducible}=0$, $\text{reproducible}=1$) with $M$ rows (total number of features) and $J$ columns ($J={I \choose 2}$) (replicate sample pairs ${I \choose 2}$), where $J$ is the total possible number of sample pairs of replicate experiments. We assign feature $m$ to be reproducible if a certain percentage signals ($100c_s\%$) are reproducible for pairwise combinations of replicate experiments, i.e., if 
$$
 	\frac{{\sum_{i<i'}{{{r_{m,{(i,i')}}}}}}}{J} >c_s,
$$
such that, $c_s \in (0,1)$.

Similarly, we assign a sample pair $(i,~i')$ to be reproducible if a certain percentage signals ($100c_m\%$) are reproducible across all metabolites, i.e., if 
$$
 \frac{\sum_{m}{{r{_{m,(i,i')}}}}}{M}>c_m,
$$
such that, $c_s \in (0,1)$. The reproducible signal matrix is shown in Figure 1 below.

# Getting Started

Load the package in R

```{r load-lib, message=FALSE}
library(marr)
```

# msprepCOPD Data

The **marr** package contains a pre-processed data `SummarizedExperiment` of 645 metabolites measured in plasma and 20 biological replicates from the multi-center Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study which was designed to study the underlying genetic factors of COPD, @Regan2010. We only used a subset of the original raw COPD data in this vignette.

## msprepCOPD data pre-processing using the **MSPrep** pipeline

The **msprepCOPD** data  in the **marr** package was pre-processed using the MSPrep software @Hughes2013. The data pre-processing include $3$ steps and they are as follows:
1. `Filtering`: Metabolites are removed if they are missing more than $80\%$ of the samples, @Bijlsma2006, @chong2018metaboanalyst. Originally, there were 662 metabolites in the raw data. After filtering, 645 metabolites remain. 

2. `Missing value imputation technique`: We apply Bayesian Principal Component Analysis (BPCA) to impute missing values @hastie1999imputing.

3. `Normalization`: Median normalization are performed.



```{r data-1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Using the `marr()` function

## Input for `marr()`

The `marr()` function must have one object as input:

1. `object`: a data frame or a matrix or a SummarizedExperiment object with abundance measurements of metabolites
(features) on the rows and replicates (samples) as the 
columns. `marr()` accepts objects which are a data 
frame or matrix with observations (e.g. metabolites) 
on the rows and replicates as the columns.

2. `pSamplepairs`: **optional** We assign a metabolite (feature) for a replicate sample pair to be reproducible using a threshold value of `pSamplepairs` ($c_s=0.75$).

3. `pFeatures`: **optional** We assign a sample pair for a metabolite (feature) to be reproducible using a threshold value of `pFeatures` ($c_m=0.75$).

4. `alpha`: **optional** level of significance to control the False Discovery rate (FDR).
Default is $0.05$ (i.e., $\alpha=0.05$). 



## Running `marr()`

### msprepCOPD SummarizedExperiment example - Evaluating reproducibility
We apply the marr procedure to assess the reproducibility of replicates in the msprepCOPD data. The distribution of reproducible pairs and metabolites (features) are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. 

 To run the `marr()` function, we only input the data object. We obtain 4 outputs after running the `marr()` function. They are shown below: 


```{r marr_output}
library(marr)
marr_output<- marr(msprepCOPD, pSamplepairs = 0.75, pFeatures = 0.75, alpha=0.05)
marr_output
## Head of reproducible sample pairs per metabolite (feature)
head(marrFeatures(marr_output))

## Head of reproducible metabolites (features) per sample pair
head(marrSamplepairs(marr_output))

## Percent of reproducible sample pairs per metabolite (feature) greater than 75%
marrFeaturesfiltered(marr_output)

## Percent of reproducible metabolites (features) per sample pair greater than 75%
marrSamplepairsfiltered(marr_output)
```

The distribution of reproducible metabolites/features (sample pairs) per sample pair (metabolite) can be 
extracted using the` marrSamplepairs()` (` marrFeatures()`) function
(see above). The distribution of reproducible metabolites/features  and sample pairs
can plotted using the `marrPlotSamplepairs()` and `marrPlotFeatures()`
functions, respectively (see below).

```{r fig.cap="Distribution of reproducible metabolites", plot-marr-Samplepairs}
marrPlotSamplepairs(marr_output)
```


```{r fig.cap="Distribution of reproducible sample pairs",plot-marr-Metabolites}
marrPlotFeatures(marr_output)
```
Figure 2 (3) illustrates percentage of reproducible metabolites (sample pairs) per sample pair (metabolite) in the $x$-axis.  In Figure 2 (3), the higher percentage of reproducible metabolites (sample pairs) per sample pair (metabolite) in the $x$-axis would indicate stronger reproducibility between the sample pairs (of a metabolite across all sample pairs).

Figure 2 (3) illustrates percentage of reproducible metabolites (sample pairs) per sample pair (metabolite) in the $x$-axis.  In Figure 2 (3), the higher percentage of reproducible metabolites (sample pairs) per sample pair (metabolite) in the $x$-axis would indicate stronger reproducibility between the sample pairs (of a metabolite across all sample pairs).
